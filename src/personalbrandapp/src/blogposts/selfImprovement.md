## My favorite Media and Self Improvement

I generally take a long term approach to how I make decisions in my everyday life, and can be focused on small changes I can make to create long term benefits. As a result, I try to focus my media attention to topics or formats that may foster growth in areas which I am interested in. Books are my favorite medium because they deliver pure information the most efficiently of all mediums. I'm also a big fan of listening to podcasts because they're great to have on while I'm doing some busy work. Lastly, I enjoy watching films that can bring new diverse perspectives to my mind. Each medium clearly has it's own flavor of benefits in self improvement!

### Print Media

I try to read a plethora of self improvement books and biographies from authors with a variety of backgrounds to find diverse thoughts on how one can improve.

- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a more traditional self help book that I find very practical in terms of actions you may take to develop great habits for self improvement. It definitely has cascading benefits due to the fundamental nature of habit and how they shape you as a person.
- "Secrets of Six Figure Women" by Barbara Stanny provides many interesting insights in how women overcome barriers to generate larger income for themselves. It really gives a diverse view of high income women from multiple industries and backgrounds, and as a result, one may find specific advice that may resonate with you.
- "Tools of Titans" by Tim Ferriss, is a collection of many great profiles of successful persons in all kinds of fields and industries. It's practically an encyclopedia of diverse perspectives on success and I expect that it'll have a lot of reread value, as a result.

### Audio Media

When it comes to audio podcasts, I have been leaning towards tech and business. I do find these topics to be very interesting and close to me professionally, and they provide interesting insight to general tech industry trends and a deeper dive into specific companies. It's great to see the medias perspective on tech and its broader impact on society. Looking at the following podcasts, I might just be a fan of the Vox Media Podcast Network.

- Pivot
- Land of the Giants
- Recode decode

### Video Media

I do continue my consumption of tech and business media in the videos I watch for the same reasons I've listed for audio. I've recently have been watching many Chinese vlogs and shows to learn mandarin and expand my understanding of Chinese culture. I'd be interested in watching a larger variety of vlogs from people with a different background from myself.
