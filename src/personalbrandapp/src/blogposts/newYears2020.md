## Happy New Year!

It’s the new year and should be an exciting one at that! This is my first new year that I’ve spent in Seattle, and I really tried to sleep through it, only to be woken excitedly by cheers and honking of the celebrating Seattleites outside! There really is a lot of life in this city! This year, I have a few resolutions where I am taking the opportunity to solidify some ideas that I would like to execute on this year. I’ve gotten a head start on most of these, so it’s already looking good! I am very excited to see what comes of them!

### Schedule my time

Here, I’m looking to timebox all of the time that I am spending outside of work, so that I may focus my time on activities that represent my ideas and values. This helps tremendously with focusing on what is important to me and in reducing distractions by giving me predetermined actions to take at any point and time. Currently, I am taking the time to schedule my days, each day at a time, but I may choose to schedule my weeks in advance to better allocate my time as appropriate to my values. I might also consider opening up more free time, so that it would be easier to maintain a regular schedule.

### Cross Training

I’m looking to change up my regular exercise routine, so that I will have a strong variety of exercises across disciplines to have a well rounded fitness plan. My intent with working out has always been to keep a healthy lifestyle, and instead of focusing on one physical activity, I decided to have a better plan with a variety of workouts. Currently, this looks like utilizing various equipment in the gym with two workout plans. The first, involves 30 minutes of hills on the treadmill, 3 sets of dumbbell bench presses, 3 sets of standing bicep curls, 3 sets of medicine ball ab twists and stretching between reps. The second, includes 30 minutes of interval rowing, 3 sets of lateral pulls or pull ups, 3 sets of weighted lunges, 3 sets of medicine ball v-sits and stretching between reps. Here I’m trying to mix different muscle groups and work on some cardio for each workout for well rounded fitness. I’d also be interested in taking some dancing and yoga lessons to add to the gym routine for more emphasis on flexibility and range of motion.

### Eat Healthy

I want to improve my diet and be more strict with what I eat regularly to maintain my health. I’m interested in executing on a healthy diet because obesity continues to be an epidemic that is plaguing this nation, and in participating with a strict healthy diet, I hope to inspire others to do the same. I have a pretty good baseline when it comes to diet and am taking a small step in a better direction to really solidify on my healthy options. First and foremost, each trip to the grocery store should focus on purchases of fresh fruits and vegetables, which I plan to make the primary source of foods that I consume. Next, I will purchase whole grains for my regular carbohydrates. For protein, I plan to increase the amount of vegetables with more beans and tofu, while decreasing meat consumption to mostly fish and chicken. Otherwise, to help maintain my diet, I will have a weekly cheat day and a few cheat treats. For now, I won’t consume any beverages outside of water and may choose to be more strict by eliminating all items with added sugars from my diet.

### Learn Mandarin

In the future, I would like to be fluent in mandarin to a native degree, so I’m making a commitment to starting that process now. I already have a fairly good baseline with regular exposure to mandarin with my parents and several years of schooling. As a result, I’m moving most of my video consumption to mandarin speaking and getting to know the Chinese characters through subtitles and video comments. I might make a larger commitment to learning mandarin by reading books or writing in Chinese.

### Blog Regularly

The main focus here is to increase my creative ability and improve my writing. In the future, I also hope to write a book to share my experiences, so I am making a commitment to writing regularly to develop the skill. This resolution also ties into development work for the website as another element of utilizing my creativity. Otherwise, I may choose to move to other creative endeavors such as film making, dancing, drawing, singing, entrepreneurism, public speaking or other creative activities that may take my interest.

### Read More

Reading continues to be my favorite form of entertainment, and I want to make a commitment for reading to be my primary source of entertainment. This would greatly reduce my time spent browsing social media, watching online films and increase my focus to specific, in depth materials on self improvement and education. I’m also curious of the history genre because history often repeats itself. I would like to execute on insights that can be taken from events from the past.
