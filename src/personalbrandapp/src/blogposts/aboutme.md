# About Me

Hi, I'm a software development engineer at Amazon. I work in the Pillpack organization and work on the retail site on projects such as enabling health benefit accounts. I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am interested in working with  a collaborative, creative and technology driven environment. It is important to me to develop great consumer products, which solve challenging and important problems such as those in education, transportation and healthcare.

In my free time, I enjoy reading up on self-improvement, exercising, going to the park and pursuing creative endeavours such as filmmaking and cooking.

## Self Improvement

I try to read a plethora of self improvement books from authors with a variety of backgrounds to find diverse thoughts on how one can improve. Some books that I found to be especially helpful or interesting are "Secrets of Six Figure Women" by Barbara Stanny, "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and "Tools of Titans" by Tim Ferriss.

## Creative Endeavors

I have had an interest in film making and video media since high school and have made a variety of films including video essays, stop motion, vlogs, live broadcast and lets play.
