# About Me

Hi, I'm a software development engineer, I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am interested in working with a collaborative, creative and technology driven environment. It is important to me to develop great consumer products, which solve challenging and important problems such as those in education, transportation and healthcare.

In my free time, I enjoy reading up on self-improvement, exercising, going to the park and pursuing creative endeavours such as filmmaking and cooking.

Everything written on this website are my own thoughts and do not represent those of my employer or of any organization I am part of.
