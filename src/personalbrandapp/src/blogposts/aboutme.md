# About Me

Hi, I'm a software development engineer at Amazon. I work in the Pillpack organization and work on the retail site on projects such as enabling health benefit accounts. I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am interested in working with  a collaborative, creative and technology driven environment. It is important to me to develop great consumer products, which solve challenging and important problems such as those in education, transportation and healthcare.

In my free time, I enjoy reading up on self-improvement, exercising, going to the park and pursuing creative endeavours such as filmmaking and cooking.
